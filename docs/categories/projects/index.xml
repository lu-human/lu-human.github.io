      <description>My PhD project involves using computational methods and cartographic techniques to explore, visualise and analyse dialectal variation.
The primary focus of my project is to develop a tone distance metric which allows dialectologists to calculate dialect distances on the tonal level. In addition, I will address dialectological questions such as &amp;ldquo;do dialect boundaries exist?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;what are transition dialects like?&amp;rdquo; for both tonal and segmental levels, using Yue as my case study.</description>

      <title>Tracing the History of Technocracy in Historical Parliamentary Debates</title>

      <description>Democracy is often said to be under the sway of &amp;ldquo;technocracy&amp;rdquo;: expert rule. Scientific institutions, experts and model have a tremendous influence on democratic decision-making, often at the cost of transparency and sovereignty. This research studies the rise of technocratic ways of thinking and the impact they have on democratic debate. It does so by mining and modelling millions of parliamentary debates from the twentieth century Dutch Lower House using NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods.</description>
