As a PhD at the intersection of Digital Humanities & Korean studies, Aron is fascinated by how computer vision can enhance our understanding of Koreaâ€™s history. A critical aspect of this field involves the classification of printshops, which can aid in identifying the origin of printed documents from the colonial period. His project also utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) and object segmentation techniques to efficiently digitize and analyze collections of Korean texts and images. By using these computer vision methods, we can gain new insights into the evolution of Korean society, as well as the cultural and historical significance of various printshops and their products.
